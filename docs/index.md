# "Trust is good, control is better"

_More preciselly Vladimir Ilitsch Lenin said "Trust but check"_

## Foreword

In this repo I want to process the **testing**  topic with similar title from [_JavaMagazin (DE) 1.2024_](https://entwickler.de/magazine-ebooks/java-magazin/java-magazin-12024) with some example. 

## First topic is Archtest 

With [Archunit](https://www.archunit.org), architecture of java application can be tested, and some critical code-bug can be avoided. You can more information [here](archunit.md)
